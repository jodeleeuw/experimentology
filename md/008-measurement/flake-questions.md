| What is your construct?                                                    | Define construct, describe theory and research.                                                                                                                                                               |
| What measure did you use to operationalize your construct?                 | Describe measure and justify operationalization.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Did you select your measure from the literature or create it from scratch? | Justify measure selection and review evidence on reliability and validity (or disclose the lack of such evidence).                                                                                            |
| Did you modify your measure during the process?                            | Describe and justify any modifications; note whether they occurred before or after data collection.                                                                                                           |
| How did you quantify your measure?                                         | Describe decisions underlying the calculation of scores on the measure; note whether these were established before or after data collection and whether they are based on standards from previous literature. |
