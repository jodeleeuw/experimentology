@article{hawkins2018,
	abstract = {Replications are important to science, but who will do them? One
               proposal is that students can conduct replications as part of
               their training. As a proof of concept for this idea, here we
               report a series of 11 preregistered replications of findings
               from the 2015 volume of Psychological Science, all conducted as
               part of a graduate-level course. As was expected given larger,
               more systematic prior efforts, the replications typically
               yielded effects that were smaller than the original ones: The
               modal outcome was partial support for the original claim. This
               work documents the challenges facing motivated students as they
               attempt to replicate previously published results on a first
               attempt. We describe the workflow and pedagogical methods that
               were used in the class and discuss implications both for the
               adoption of this pedagogical model and for replication research
               more broadly.},

	abstract = {The university participant pool is a key resource for behavioral
              research, and data quality is believed to vary over the course of
              the academic semester. This crowdsourced project examined time of
              semester variation in 10 known effects, 10 individual
              differences, and 3 data quality indicators over the course of the
              academic semester in 20 participant pools (N=2696) and with an
              online sample (N=737). Weak time of semester effects were
              observed on data quality indicators, participant sex, and a few
              individual differences---conscientiousness, mood, and stress.
              However, there was little evidence for time of semester
              qualifying experimental or correlational effects. The generality
              of this evidence is unknown because only a subset of the tested
              effects demonstrated evidence for the original result in the
              whole sample. Mean characteristics of pool samples change
              slightly during the semester, but these data suggest that those
              changes are mostly irrelevant for detecting effects.},

              limited by error variance in manipulation and measurement. Effect
              sizes exceeding these limits are implausible and should be viewed
              with skepticism. Maximal positive controls, experimental
              conditions that should show an obvious and predictable effect,
              can provide estimates of the upper limits of plausible effect
              sizes on a measure. In this work, maximal positive controls are
              conducted for three measures of aggressive cognition, and the
              effect sizes obtained are compared to studies found through
              systematic review. Questions are raised regarding the
              plausibility of certain reports with effect sizes comparable to,
              or in excess of, the effect sizes found in maximal positive
              controls. Maximal positive controls may provide a means to

              prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of
              selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices,
              complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in
              response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of
              null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift
              from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred
              techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices,
              including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals,
              and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them
              widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly
              beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are
              important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an
              eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity,
              which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation
              terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a
              cumulative quantitative discipline.},

	abstract = {Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) is an online crowdsourcing service
              where anonymous online workers complete web-based tasks for small
              sums of money. The service has attracted attention from
              experimental psychologists interested in gathering human subject
              data more efficiently. However, relative to traditional
              laboratory studies, many aspects of the testing environment are
              not under the experimenter's control. In this paper, we attempt
              to empirically evaluate the fidelity of the AMT system for use in
              cognitive behavioral experiments. These types of experiment
              differ from simple surveys in that they require multiple trials,
              sustained attention from participants, comprehension of complex
              instructions, and millisecond accuracy for response recording and
              stimulus presentation. We replicate a diverse body of tasks from
              experimental psychology including the Stroop, Switching, Flanker,
              Simon, Posner Cuing, attentional blink, subliminal priming, and
              category learning tasks using participants recruited using AMT.
              While most of replications were qualitatively successful and
              validated the approach of collecting data anonymously online
              using a web-browser, others revealed disparity between laboratory
              results and online results. A number of important lessons were
              encountered in the process of conducting these replications that
              should be of value to other researchers.},

	abstract = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature,
              yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential
              statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative
              to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical
              expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned-that is, that
              the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical
              observations. Here I argue that many applications of statistical
              inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition.
              Focusing on the most widely used class of model in psychology-the
              linear mixed model-I explore the consequences of failing to
              statistically operationalize verbal hypotheses in a way that
              respects researchers' actual generalization intentions. I
              demonstrate that whereas the ``random effect'' formalism is used
              pervasively in psychology to model inter-subject variability, few
              researchers accord the same treatment to other variables they
              clearly intend to generalize over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or
              research sites). The under-specification of random effects
              imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of
              results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these
              constraints can dramatically inflate false positive rates, and
              often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations
              that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities
              they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to take the
              alignment between verbal and statistical expressions seriously
              lies at the heart of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g.,
              the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of
              several potential avenues for improvement.},

              counseling, social, personality, school, and community) lack the
              cumulative character of scientific knowledge because they tend
              neither to be refuted nor corroborated, but instead merely fade
              away as people lose interest. Even though intrinsic subject
              matter difficulties (20 are listed) contribute to this, the
              excessive reliance on significance testing is partly responsible
              (Ronald A. Fisher). Karl Popper's approach, with modifications,
              would be prophylactic. Since the null hypothesis is quasi-always
              false, tables summarizing research in terms of patterns of
              ``significant differences'' are little more than complex,
              causally uninterpretable outcomes of statistical power functions.
              Multiple paths to estimating numerical point values
              (``consistency tests'') are better, even if approximate with
              rough tolerances; and lacking this, ranges, orderings, 2nd-order
              differences, curve peaks and valleys, and function forms should
              be used. Such methods are usual in developed sciences that seldom
              report statistical significance. Consistency tests of a

               Exploratory Data Analysis and Tufte's books in the succeeding
               decades. But statistical graphics still occupy an awkward
               in-between position: within statistics, exploratory and
               graphical methods represent a minor subfield and are not well
               integrated with larger themes of modeling and inference. Outside
               of statistics, infographics (also called information
               visualization or Infovis) are huge, but their purveyors and
               enthusiasts appear largely to be uninterested in statistical
               principles.We present here a set of goals for graphical displays

	abstract = {Summary Increasingly, researchers are attempting to replicate
               published original studies by using large, multisite replication
               projects, at least 134 of which have been completed or are on
               going. These designs are promising to assess whether the
               original study is statistically consistent with the replications
               and to reassess the strength of evidence for the scientific
               effect of interest. However, existing analyses generally focus
               on single replications; when applied to multisite designs, they
               provide an incomplete view of aggregate evidence and can lead to
               misleading conclusions about replication success. We propose new
               statistical metrics representing firstly the probability that
               the original study's point estimate would be at least as extreme
               as it actually was, if in fact the original study were
               statistically consistent with the replications, and secondly the
               estimated proportion of population effects agreeing in direction
               with the original study. Generalized versions of the second
               metric enable consideration of only meaningfully strong
               population effects that agree in direction, or alternatively
               that disagree in direction, with the original study. These
               metrics apply when there are at least 10 replications (unless
               the heterogeneity estimate $\tau$^=0, in which case the metrics
               apply regardless of the number of replications). The first
               metric assumes normal population effects but appears robust to
               violations in simulations; the second is distribution free. We
               provide R packages (Replicate and MetaUtility).},

	abstract = {Unplanned optional stopping rules have been criticized for
              inflating Type I error rates under the null hypothesis
              significance testing (NHST) paradigm. Despite these criticisms,
              this research practice is not uncommon, probably because it
              appeals to researcher's intuition to collect more data to push an
              indecisive result into a decisive region. In this contribution,
              we investigate the properties of a procedure for Bayesian
              hypothesis testing that allows optional stopping with unlimited
              multiple testing, even after each participant. In this procedure,
              which we call Sequential Bayes Factors (SBFs), Bayes factors are
              computed until an a priori defined level of evidence is reached.
              This allows flexible sampling plans and is not dependent upon
              correct effect size guesses in an a priori power analysis. We
              investigated the long-term rate of misleading evidence, the
              average expected sample sizes, and the biasedness of effect size
              estimates when an SBF design is applied to a test of mean
              differences between 2 groups. Compared with optimal NHST, the SBF
              design typically needs 50\% to 70\% smaller samples to reach a
              conclusion about the presence of an effect, while having the same
              or lower long-term rate of wrong inference. (PsycINFO Database

	abstract = {This study documents reporting errors in a sample of over 250,000
              p-values reported in eight major psychology journals from 1985
              until 2013, using the new R package ``statcheck.'' statcheck
              retrieved null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) results
              from over half of the articles from this period. In line with
              earlier research, we found that half of all published psychology
              papers that use NHST contained at least one p-value that was
              inconsistent with its test statistic and degrees of freedom. One
              in eight papers contained a grossly inconsistent p-value that may
              have affected the statistical conclusion. In contrast to earlier
              findings, we found that the average prevalence of inconsistent
              p-values has been stable over the years or has declined. The
              prevalence of gross inconsistencies was higher in p-values
              reported as significant than in p-values reported as
              nonsignificant. This could indicate a systematic bias in favor of
              significant results. Possible solutions for the high prevalence
              of reporting inconsistencies could be to encourage sharing data,
              to let co-authors check results in a so-called ``co-pilot
              model,'' and to use statcheck to flag possible inconsistencies in
              one's own manuscript or during the review process.},

              materials almost never provide statistical evidence that their
              findings generalize beyond the specific sample of language
              materials they have chosen. Nevertheless, these same
              investigators do not hesitate to conclude that their findings are
              true for language in general. In so doing, it is argued, they are
              committing the language-as-fixed-effect fallacy, which can lead
              to serious error. The problem is illustrated for one well-known
              series of studies in semantic memory. With the appropriate
              statistics these studies are shown to provide no reliable
              evidence for most of the main conclusions drawn from them. A
              review of other experiments in semantic memory shows that many of

              can be avoided by doing the right statistics, selecting the
              appropriate design, and sampling by systematic procedures, or,

@article{moshontz2018,
	abstract = {Concerns have been growing about the veracity of psychological
              research. Many findings in psychological science are based on
              studies with insufficient statistical power and nonrepresentative
              samples, or may otherwise be limited to specific, ungeneralizable
              settings or populations. Crowdsourced research, a type of
              large-scale collaboration in which one or more research projects
              are conducted across multiple lab sites, offers a pragmatic
              solution to these and other current methodological challenges.
              The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) is a distributed
              network of laboratories designed to enable and support
              crowdsourced research projects. These projects can focus on novel
              research questions, or attempt to replicate prior research, in
              large, diverse samples. The PSA's mission is to accelerate the
              accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in
              psychological science. Here, we describe the background,
              structure, principles, procedures, benefits, and challenges of
              the PSA. In contrast to other crowdsourced research networks, the
              PSA is ongoing (as opposed to time-limited), efficient (in terms
              of re-using structures and principles for different projects),
              decentralized, diverse (in terms of participants and
              researchers), and inclusive (of proposals, contributions, and
              other relevant input from anyone inside or outside of the
              network). The PSA and other approaches to crowdsourced
              psychological science will advance our understanding of mental
              processes and behaviors by enabling rigorous research and
              systematically examining its generalizability.},
